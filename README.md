# What is React?

## Overview

In the world of web development, there are a number of hip names tossed around -
Angular, Vue, React.  These are some of the front end frameworks that have
gained popularity over the last few years. These frameworks provide a
standardized way of creating and deploying web applications. This allows web
developers to put most of their energy and focus on designing a good experience
for end users of the application.

These lessons are all about just one framework, React. Why learn React? In the
last few years, React has surpassed other frameworks in popularity and demand.
For good reason, too! In this lesson, we will discuss what React is and why it
is so awesome and useful.

## Objectives

- Introduce the React framework at a high level
- Explain some of the benefits of using React when developing web applications

## What is React?

The React framework is a built entirely out of JavaScript, using a complex
combination of dependencies. Using React, though, might seem significantly
different than what you're used to in building JavaScript from scratch. React
provides a specific way to organize and structure the design of a web
application.

Using JSX, an extension of vanilla JavaScript with a specific new syntax, we can
write code that looks very similar to HTML. Snippets of this JSX get separated
out in components, sort of like building blocks - pieces, combined together,
that build a fully working web application. These components let us separate
code and functionality in a logical and easy to read way, producing highly
reusable, independent chunks.

## Some of the Awesome Features of React

React is more than that JSX and components - React has a lot going on under the
hood. Just to briefly touch on some of the cool features, React includes:

- a virtual DOM that allows for fast, efficient content rendering. Great for
highly interactive apps
- a declarative writing structure, allowing you to simply express how your app
should look and let React handle updates and underlying data changes
- Babel, an included transpiler that converts modern JavaScript and custom
code like JSX into more widely compatible JavaScript
- Webpack, a 'bundler' that takes all our work, along with any required dependency
code, and packages it all up in a single, transferrable bundle
- Built in ESLint functionality to help improve our code

React also has a recommended tool, `create-react-app`, that makes it easy to
create a new React project from scratch.  The `create-react-app` tool sets up
preconfigured folders and files, all the necessary parts and more. This package
includes functionality built to be mobile friendly and progressive. That means
apps will work on all browsers and mobile devices, and can load even if the
device is _offline_.

React is actively maintained by Facebook, and new features are added regularly!
Once you have a good grasp on React, you will have the ability to create cutting
edge web applications and sites. Knowing React also opens doors to similar
frameworks, such as React Native for building mobile apps.

### Conclusion

You can imagine a framework is like a car - while it is interesting and useful
to know how the engine works or how to fix a transmission, it isn't necessary
for using the car to get where you want to go. What is necessary is that you
understand how to use the pedals, turn the wheel and change gears.

Through the earlier lessons in this section, we will be covering what you need
to know to use React. Later, we'll go into more detail on the critical parts,
the engine under the hood. By the end, you will be able to quickly design and
create your own React apps!
